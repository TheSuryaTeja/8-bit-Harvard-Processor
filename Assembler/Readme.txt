USAGE : 

 1. Create a .txt file named  "input.txt"
 2. Write assembly code in it
 3. Save and Exit
 4. Now run "alpha.exe" in the same directory.
 5. File "output.exe" will be automatically created in same directory with 32 bit opcodes

PS : This output file can be directly read into testbench using verilog and used.
